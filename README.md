## Welcome!
CrabNets is one of the few Rust libraries that enable developers to  build,  analyse
and manipulate graphs/networks.

## Features
* **Different families of graphs with unified interface**  Build  simple  graphs  or
multi-graphs with directed or undirected edges and maniputate all of them  with  the
same set of functions!
* **Attributes** Add your custom attributes to vertices or edges  or  even  both  of
them!
